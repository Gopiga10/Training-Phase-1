    " Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast datasets collected from the internet, books, and other text sources. However, these datasets often contain implicit biases that get reflected in AI-generated outputs. This leads to skewed responses, reinforcing stereotypes, cultural imbalances, and misrepresentations."
